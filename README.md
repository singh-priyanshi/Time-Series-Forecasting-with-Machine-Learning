## Project Overview
Time series forecasting is a crucial component of many applications, including finance, demand forecasting, weather prediction, and more. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and predict trends from sequential data.

Key features of this project include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time series data
- Implementation of various forecasting models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of forecasts

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises historical data points, with each entry representing a timestamp and the associated metric (e.g., sales, temperature, etc.).

- **Source**: [Include data source if applicable]
- **Structure**: Include a brief description of the dataset structure and key features

## Models Implemented
The project explores and compares several time series forecasting models, including but not limited to:
1. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network**
3. **Prophet Model**

Each model is evaluated based on forecast accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies to run the code:

bash
git clone https://github.com/singh-priyanshi/Time-Series-Forecasting.git
cd Time-Series-Forecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage
Load the dataset in the specified format.
Run the notebooks to preprocess data and apply forecasting models.
Compare model performance based on evaluation metrics provided in the notebooks.

bash
# Example command to run a specific model script
python arima_model.py

### Results
The results of each model are discussed in terms of metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Forecasts are visualized for a better understanding of model performance and trend predictions.
